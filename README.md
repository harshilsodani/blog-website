## Project Structure

Below is the structure of your Digivarta project:

- **views**: Contains the EJS templates used for rendering HTML pages. Here's a breakdown of the templates:

     - **partials**: This subdirectory contains partial EJS templates that can be reused across multiple pages for consistency. Examples include the header and footer.

          - **footer.ejs**: The template for the website's footer section.

          - **header.ejs**: The template for the website's header section.

   - **about.ejs**: The template for the "About" page.

   - **compose.ejs**: The template for composing new blog posts.

   - **contact.ejs**: The template for the "Contact" page.

   - **error.ejs**: The template for displaying error messages.

   - **home.ejs**: The template for the homepage where blog posts are displayed.

   - **modify.ejs**: The template for editing existing blog posts.

   - **post.ejs**: The template for displaying individual blog posts.

- **.gitignore**: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git, typically build artifacts, dependencies, and sensitive configuration files.

- **app.js**: The main application file that configures the Express.js web server and sets up routes and middleware.

- **package-lock.json**: A file generated by npm that locks the versions of installed packages, ensuring consistent installations across environments.

- **package.json**: The npm package configuration file, specifying project dependencies and metadata.

This structured layout helps keep your project organized, with clear separation between static assets, templates, server-side code, and configuration files. You can customize and expand on this structure as your project evolves.
